# Introduction
Introducing Pathfinding Visualiser!

Pathfinding algorithms was one of the topics introduced in my studies in computer science which I found especially fascinating as you get an instant sense of how it may be applied to real life scenarios (e.g. Google maps). Often times I've learned from colleagues in my school days and even experienced myself that adding some sort of imagery or visualisation to a technical or mathematical concept adds that extra layer to really engage people and make the learning experience all the more fun.

While my professional experience is backend dominant, this was also a great way to for me to delve into the world of frontend as I've always felt the need to migrate to full stack to become 'complete' :) and this marks one of the first steps in my quest to reaching that. 

# About the project
Currently focused on illustrating how Djikstra's algorithm searches for the shortest path in a weighted graph between a start and destination node.
